| **Core Tech**     | Photorealistic, from user-uploaded photo| Stylized, customizable 3D models            | Doppl  |
| **Realism**         | High, focuses on fabric physics & fit       | Medium, more artistic and game-like         | Doppl  |

| **Pricing**         | Freemium with generation limits           | Primarily a one-time purchase               | GenSMO |

### Round 1: Realism and Practicality

If your main goal is to see how real clothes will actually look on your body, **Doppl is the clear winner**. Its technology is built from the ground up to create a realistic try-on experience. GenSMO's avatars, while fun, are more like high-end video game characters and don't provide the same level of accuracy for fit.

### Round 2: Creativity and Community

If you're more interested in fashion as a form of creative expression and community engagement, **GenSMO has the edge**. Its built-in social feed and focus on digital-only fashion encourage more experimental and artistic creations. Doppl is more of a personal utility, while GenSMO is a social network.

### Our Recommendation

*   **Choose Doppl if:** You are a practical shopper who wants to check the fit of real-world clothes before you buy online. You value realism and accuracy above all else.
*   **Choose GenSMO if:** You are a fashion creative who enjoys building fantastical outfits and sharing them with a community. You are more interested in digital fashion as a hobby.

For our audience, focused on finding the best tool for real-world style, **we recommend Doppl** as the more practical and useful application.
