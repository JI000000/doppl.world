## ⚠️ A Critical Warning: The Dangers of Unofficial APK Files

You may see other websites offering a "Doppl APK" file for download. **We strongly advise against downloading these.** An APK (Android Package Kit) is the file format used by Android to distribute and install mobile apps. Sideloading unofficial APKs from untrusted sources carries significant risks:

1.  **Malware and Viruses:** Unofficial APKs can be modified to include malware that steals your personal data, passwords, and financial information.
2.  **No Updates:** You will not receive critical security patches or feature updates, leaving your app and data vulnerable.
3.  **App Malfunction:** The app may not work correctly or could crash frequently.
4.  **Security Risk:** You are bypassing the security checks that the Google Play Store provides.

**Bottom line: Stick to the official app stores. It's not worth compromising your security.**

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Is the Doppl app free?**
A: Yes, the Doppl app is free to download and use, though it has a limit on the number of looks you can generate each month.

**Q: When will Doppl be available in my country (UK, Canada, Europe, India, etc.)?**
A: Google has stated they plan to roll out Doppl to more countries in the future, but no specific dates have been announced. We are actively monitoring this and will provide updates as soon as they are available.

**Q: I don't have a Pixel phone. Can I use it on my Samsung or other Android device?**
A: Not at this time. The Android version is currently exclusive to Google's Pixel lineup. This may change as the experiment progresses.
