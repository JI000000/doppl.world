Doppl is a powerful tool, but like any tool, using it correctly makes all the difference. If you're new to the app, we recommend starting with our **[Ultimate Guide to Google's Doppl App](/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-doppl)** to get a handle on the basics.

Once you're set up, make sure you're not making these common mistakes. Let's find out and fix them.

### Mistake 1: Using a Poor-Quality Photo

This is the single biggest mistake. A low-light, angled, or cluttered photo will result in an inaccurate model, and clothes won't generate correctly.

*   **The Fix:** Stand in a brightly and evenly lit room. Wear form-fitting clothing (like activewear). Stand straight, face the camera, and have someone else take a full-body photo of you. Make sure the background is as plain as possible.

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Outfit Context

You found a dress that looks great, but you ignored that it's "Satin" and you were looking for "Cotton". The generated image might be right, but the real-world drape, sheen, and feel will be completely different.

*   **The Fix:** Pay attention to the original context of the clothing image you upload. Doppl's AI does an excellent job simulating different fabrics and styles, so use that information to your advantage to understand the item's true character.

### Mistake 3: Only Trying on One Style

You might be used to a certain style, but sticking to one look across the entire app will lead to missed opportunities.

*   **The Fix:** The virtual try-on is the perfect, no-risk way to experiment. Try on a size up and a size down. This helps you find the perfect fit for each specific brand and item.

### Mistake 4: Not Saving Your Favorite Looks

Mindlessly generating new looks is fun, but you'll quickly forget the great items you found.

*   **The Fix:** Whenever you find an item you love, save it. If you create a full outfit you're proud of, save it. This builds a curated library of your personal style.

### Mistake 5: Staying in Your Comfort Zone

The whole point of Doppl is to experiment without risk. If you only try on the same styles you already own, you're missing out on the app's biggest benefit.

*   **The Fix:** Make a point to try on at least one "wildcard" item every time you use the app. Try a color you've never worn, a style you were unsure about, or a brand you've never heard of. You might be surprised by what you discover!
