Doppl is a powerful tool, but like any tool, using it correctly makes all the difference. Are you making these common mistakes? Let's find out and fix them.

### Mistake 1: Using a Poor-Quality Photo for Your Avatar

This is the single biggest mistake. A low-light, angled, or cluttered photo will result in an inaccurate avatar, and clothes won't fit correctly.

*   **The Fix:** Stand in a brightly and evenly lit room. Wear form-fitting clothing (like activewear). Stand straight, face the camera, and have someone else take a full-body photo of you from about 10 feet away. Make sure the background is as plain as possible.

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Fabric Type

You found a dress that looks great, but you ignored that it's "Satin" and you were looking for "Cotton". The fit might be right, but the real-world drape, sheen, and feel will be completely different.

*   **The Fix:** Always check the material information provided for each garment. Doppl's AI does an excellent job simulating different fabrics, so use that information to your advantage to understand the item's true character.

### Mistake 3: Only Trying on One Size

You might be a "Medium" in one brand, but a "Large" in another. Sticking to one size across the entire app will lead to inaccurate fit assessments.

*   **The Fix:** Always try on a size up and a size down from your usual. This is the virtual equivalent of taking multiple sizes into a physical fitting room. It helps you find the perfect fit for each specific brand and item.

### Mistake 4: Not Using the "Favorites" or "Lookbook" Feature

Mindlessly swiping through clothes is fun, but you'll quickly forget the great items you found.

*   **The Fix:** Whenever you find an item you love, tap the heart icon to add it to your "Favorites." If you create a full outfit you're proud of, save it to your "Lookbook." This builds a curated library of your personal style.

### Mistake 5: Staying in Your Comfort Zone

The whole point of Doppl is to experiment without risk. If you only try on the same styles you already own, you're missing out on the app's biggest benefit.

*   **The Fix:** Make a point to try on at least one "wildcard" item every time you use the app. Try a color you've never worn, a style you were unsure about, or a brand you've never heard of. You might be surprised by what you discover!
